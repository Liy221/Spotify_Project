# Spotify_Project
MSBA collab on analyzing a spotify dataset

This Git Hub page is used for MSBA Database Management Project Group's final project management.
We will be working on a song.db file that contains thousands of song data point and analyze their impacts on the music's popularity.

We will use Git as a management tool by synching our sql script in the python environment.
